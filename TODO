ideally we want something like this:

-------------------------
file called "index.html":
-------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>current time</title>
</head>
<body>
 <p>the current universal time is
  <(
   (get-universal-time)
   )>
 </p>
</body>
</html>

-------------------------

so essentially the <( tag works like php's <?php with )> as php's ?>

i've started this project with no plan on how to get it done, in fact,
that's one of the main reasons i decided to start it, to have the experience
of now knowing at all how to accomplish a goal yet set out to do it anyway.
