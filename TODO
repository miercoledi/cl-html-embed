ideally we want something like this:

-------------------------
file called "index.html":
-------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>current time</title>
</head>
<body>
 <p>the current universal time is
  <(
   (get-universal-time)
   )>
 </p>
</body>
</html>

-------------------------

so essentially the <( tag works like php's <?php with )> as php's ?>

i've started this project with no plan on how to get it done, in fact,
that's one of the main reasons i decided to start it, to have the experience
of now knowing at all how to accomplish a goal yet set out to do it anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the new file, process-html-file.lisp, will read an html file to a string, then,
identify each instance of html-embedded lisp code, process the code instances,
replace the embedded code with that to which it evaluates when treated as lisp.

this is great yes, but how will we designate particular html files as containing
embedded lisp? first thought may be by file extension. just as .php files are
processed as html until the <?php indicator tells it to work as php (and the ?>
indicator tells it to stop) we could have a .htcl extension indicate that the
file is hypertext with embedded commonlisp.

a file with that extension would then do a few things:

1) run itself through process-html-file.lisp
2) save the results of filename.htcl to filename.html
3) direct the browser to the html file and
4) keep the contents of the htcl file hidden

what will this mean? can i get around dealing with the webserver? perhaps an
index lisp file, processed as a sbcl shell script using modlisp2 under apache,
could read the directory, take directions, and create the appropriate files
...

we'll get to that after properly processing a html-with-embedded-cl file.
